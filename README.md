## 🎓 42 Berlin Projects

### 🐚 [MiniShell](https://github.com/Ghazaleh-ans/sadaf)
A Unix shell implementation in C, featuring command parsing, environment variables, redirections, pipes, and signal handling.

### 🤔 [Philosophers](https://github.com/Ghazaleh-ans/Philosophers)
Solving the classic dining philosophers problem using multithreading and mutexes to explore concurrency and synchronization.

### 🎮 [Cub3D](https://github.com/Ghazaleh-ans/cub3D)
A 3D graphics engine built using raycasting techniques, inspired by Wolfenstein 3D. Implemented in C with real-time rendering.

### 🌐 [NetPractice](https://github.com/Ghazaleh-ans/Netpractice)
Comprehensive TCP/IP networking project covering subnet masks, routing tables, and network topology configuration across 10 progressive levels.

### 🔷 [CPP Modules](https://github.com/Ghazaleh-ans/CPP)
Deep dive into C++ and Object-Oriented Programming through progressive modules covering classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, C++ cast operators (static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast), templates, STL containers, iterators, and exception handling.

### 🎨 [Fract-ol](https://github.com/Ghazaleh-ans/fractol)
Interactive fractal visualization program rendering Mandelbrot and Julia sets [and more sets]with real-time zooming, color schemes, and mouse-based navigation using the MiniLibX graphics library.

### 🔄 [Pipex](https://github.com/Ghazaleh-ans/pipex)
Recreation of shell pipe behavior, handling process creation, file descriptors, and inter-process communication to execute commands with pipes.


## 📚 Current Focus

- 📱 iOS Development (Swift & UIKit)
- 🔧 Advanced C++ (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Exception Handling)
- 🎯 Technical Interview Preparation
- 🌟 Open Source Contributions

## 🎯 Professional Goals

I'm actively seeking **software engineering internships/graduate positions** and **junior positions** where I can apply my software engineering knowledge and learn from skilled engineers. I'm particularly interested in roles involving systems software, backend development, or mobile app development.
